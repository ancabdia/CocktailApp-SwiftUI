# Introduction
This project aims to apply the contents taught during the bootcamp training received by OpenBank during the period of July and August. 

Within this project we have applied knowledge of the different modules that have been taught such as: version control **Git/GitHub**, **UX/UI** design, iOS programming using **SwiftUI** applying **clean architecture** through different calls to an **API**, testing using **XCTest** and applying accessibility to the project using **VoiceOver**.

The purpose of this project will be therefore, to create an application that will show through the use of the api of [API link](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/) an application that will consist of 5 screens, which will allow us to visualize the creation of cocktails, their ingredients, quantities and description of the same. To do this we can either generate cocktails randomly, or through a search engine filter the results to display.

# Design of the app
Regarding the design of the mass, through the following [link](https://www.figma.com/file/5tnJKBkseXvNR9YyYvTSIZ/Cocktails-APP?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=weC67D9D0do84zlV-1) you can view the design process and mockup of the application which was made in the early stages of the project process. In order to plan the HU and use cases to implement, in addition to creating a design (UI / UX) that allows navigation through it.

# MVVM

## What is MVVM? [^1]
It is an application structure modeling standard that consists of a series of layers and phases that communicate with each other.

[^1]: https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/dotnet/architecture/maui/mvvm

### Model
Model classes are non-visual classes that encapsulate application data. Therefore, the model can be thought of as representing the application domain model, which typically includes a data model along with validation and business logic. Examples of model objects are data transfer objects (DTOs), plain old CLR objects (POCOs), and generated entity and proxy objects.

Model classes are often used in conjunction with services or repositories that encapsulate data access and caching.

### View
The view is responsible for defining the structure, layout and appearance of what the user sees on the screen. Ideally, with limited underlying code that contains no business logic. However, in some cases, the underlying code might contain user interface logic that implements visual behavior that is difficult to express such as animations.

### ViewModel
The view model implements properties and commands to which the view can bind data, and notifies the view of state changes via change notification events. The properties and commands provided by the view model define the functionality provided by the user interface, but the view determines how that functionality is to be displayed.

## User's guide
Once the application is started, you can randomly generate a cocktail in the main screen and visualize the details of the cocktail.

In the second tabItem you can search through the search and find a desired cocktail either with or without alcohol and also access the details of the same.

Finally in the Settings menu you will be able to consult the cocktails saved as favorites, by refreshing it (dragging downwards) you will be able to update the view of it. Finally, at the bottom there is a Google button where you can modify the thematic appearance of the application.
